	<h1>Technical Vocational Livelihood</h1>


	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TVL track is designed to equip students with technical and vocational skills that are in demand in various industries. 
	<br>In the programming strand, students are likely to learn specific skills related to computer programming, software development, and information technology.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curriculum in a TVL programming strand typically includes subjects such as programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++), 
	<br>web development, database management, software engineering principles, and possibly some basics of networking or system administration.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TVL programs usually emphasize hands-on training and practical application of skills. Students may engage in projects, 
	<br>coding exercises, and possibly internships or on-the-job training to gain real-world experience in programming.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curriculum is often designed in collaboration with industry partners to ensure that students are learning skills that are relevant 
	<br>and in demand in the job market. This may include guest lectures, industry visits, or participation in industry-led projects.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some TVL programming strands may offer opportunities for students to earn industry-recognized certifications or credentials, which can 
	<br>enhance their employability upon graduation.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduates of a TVL programming strand may pursue various career pathways, including software developer, web developer, IT support specialist, 
	<br>database administrator, or software tester, among others. Some students may also choose to continue their education in college or vocational schools to further specialize in 
	<br>programming or related fields.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the TVL programming strand in senior high school provides students with a solid foundation in programming and information technology, 
	<br>preparing them for entry-level positions in the tech industry or for further education and training in related fields.
